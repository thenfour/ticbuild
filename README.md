# ticbuild

A build & watch system for TIC-80 cart development.

* Multi-file Lua dev system
* Watch system: live-update a running tic80 when dependent files are updated.
* Timing and profiling information
* Import data from existing carts
* Rich Lua preprocessing
* Code size up to 512kb
* Arbitrary binary & text importing, decoding, encoding.

# 2-minute quick start

The best dev experience is through:

* Windows
* VS Code as your editor

If you're cool with that, this is going to be easy. Open a command prompt and follow this:

```bash
# Install ticbuild so it's usable on the system as `ticbuild`
> npm install -g ticbuild

# go where you want to create the project
> cd c:\my_projects

# Initialize a minimal example project
> ticbuild init MyDemo

# Open VS Code
> code MyDemo
```

In VS Code, hit <kbd>F5</kbd> to build and watch for changes. A TIC-80 opens
with the example project.

Open `src/main.lua`. Change the background color:

```lua
  cls(9) -- changed from cls(0)
```

When you save the file, violà, the TIC-80 shows the new background color.

Also notice the TIC-80 shows timing and FPS information.

For the full experience, now install [the VS Code syntax highlighting extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TridentLoop.ticbuild-vs-code)

And you will get full syntax highlighting for the Lua language extensions.

# Installation

Install ticbuild globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g ticbuild
```

## Lua preprocessor + syntax highlighting

See [ticbuild_vscode](https://github.com/thenfour/ticbuild_vscode) for adding
syntax highlighting to make the Lua preprocessing more friendly in VS Code.

## Prerequisites

- Windows (most is cross-platform however launching is strictly windows)
- Node.js (v16 or higher)

# How to use: overview

```bash

# see detailed help
ticbuild help

# see help for a specific command
ticbuild help build

# build from manifest -> .tic cart
ticbuild build

# build and launch in a tic80
ticbuild run

# build and live-update with changes in a tic80
ticbuild watch

# interactive Lua preprocessing/minification REPL
ticbuild repl

# create a new empty project
ticbuild init

```

## REPL mode (interactive preprocessing/minification)

Interactive Lua processing on the command line, using the same context as
the build process. Useful for testing / debugging, or just doing some ad-hock
encoding.

Note: It doesn't actually EXECUTE the Lua. Just outputs the preprocessed + minified
Lua code.

### Usage

```bash
ticbuild repl [manifest] [--multi-line] [--mode <name>] [--var <key=value>]
```

* **Manifest and build configuration**
  * The REPL loads the project in the same way as `build`.
  * `--mode` and `--var` are supported

* **Single-line mode (default)**
  * Each line you enter is processed immediately.
  * The resulting Lua code is printed to stdout after each line.

* **Multi-line mode**
  * Enable with `--multi-line`.
  * Input is collected until a terminator is entered on its own line:
    * `:end`, `:eof`, or a lone `:`
  * Once the terminator is received, the full block is processed and printed.

### REPL commands

Commands always start with `:`.

```
:help
:minify on
:minify off
:minify <rule> on
:minify <rule> off
:end
:eof
:
:quit
```

#### `:minify` details

* `:minify on|off` toggles overall minification for the session.
* `:minify <rule> on|off` overrides individual minification rules. rules:

```
stripComments
renameLocalVariables
aliasRepeatedExpressions
aliasLiterals
simplifyExpressions
removeUnusedLocals
removeUnusedFunctions
renameTableFields
packLocalDeclarations
```

These overrides are applied on top of the manifest’s
`assembly.lua.minification` settings.

### Examples

```bash
# default single-line mode
ticbuild repl

# multi-line input mode
ticbuild repl --multi-line
```

## TIC-80 binary location

By default, `ticbuild` will use a special build of TIC-80 which allows profiling and
interop to support remote control.

If you want to use your own or external TIC-80, set an environment variable
(via `.env` and `.env.local`) `USE_EXTERNAL_TIC80=1`.

The TIC-80 location is searched in the `%PATH%`, but otherwise it can be overridden
via `.env` / `.env.local` in the project directory, with the key `TIC80_LOCATION`,
as a full path to `tic80.exe`.

```bash
USE_EXTERNAL_TIC80=1                    # use own build of tic80.exe. defaults to falsy
TIC80_LOCATION=c:\my\custom\tic80.exe # optional. ignored without USE_EXTERNAL_TIC80=1
```

# Project manifest

The manifest file is canonically `*.ticbuild.jsonc`. Its location defines the project root.

```jsonc
// paths are always relative to the manifest file's dir (which defines the project root dir)
// fyi, reference: https://github.com/nesbox/TIC-80/wiki/.tic-File-Format

# Lua preprocessor

ticbuild supports a fairly sophisticated Lua preprocessor, so you can have interaction
between files, inline macros, access project variables, import assets, conditionally branch,
and even import binaries with various encodings.

```lua
-- Simple text-based Lua preprocessor.
-- we want to support a few preprocessor features, and make the syntax not totally
-- break the language syntax. therefore, we will put it in comments.
-- Expressions and syntax should feel Lua-ish (not C++-ish, despite the preprocessor
-- directive set being C++-like).

--#pragma once -- useful for utils that will get included by multiple things.

--#define DEBUG 1
--#define SHOW_HUD -- bool-ish evals to true.
--#define PI 3.14

-- Expressions are Lua, and are evaluated immediately on parse.
--#define TAU PI*2
print() --#define XYZ -- note that here #define will not be processed.
  --#define XYZ -- but here it will be (whitespace allowed before)

-- Note that #defines do NOT result in Lua symbols or text replacement; they are
-- not macros, they are only recognized in other preprocessor directives.

--#include "utils/math.lua" -- extra comments are allowed in directive lines.
--#include "import:music-imported-cart:CODE" -- includes the imported code sub-asset from that cart
--#include "import:cart-with-only-code-chunk" -- implicit code-only import. If that cart contains more than CODE chunks, then you MUST specify ":CODE".

-- you can set variables that the included file can read
-- note that #pragma once will key against the filename AND its input variables.
-- the key/value style is Lua.
--#include "bayerKernel.lua" with { BAYER_SIZE = 4, DEBUG = true }

--#if DEBUG
print("debug")
--#else
-- something
--#endif -- DEBUG

--#if BAYER_SIZE == 4
-- ...
--#endif

--#if not defined(MAX_VOICES)
--#define MAX_VOICES 8
--#endif

-- Undefined preproc symbols shall not be `nil` even if that might feel natural.
-- using them in an expression shall be an error. Testing existence must be done
-- via `defined()`.

-- To be as "lua" as possible, `then` may feel natural at the end of that line,
--#if (MAX_VOICES < 4) then
--...
-- but don't support this. doesn't add anything and making it optional is unnecessary
-- complexity.

-- undefine:
--#undef MAX_VOICES

-- Access build system variables through a special function-like symbol
-- this will perform string substitutions and return the string. It will be done
-- at the preprocessor level though, and emitted as a string literal.
local s = __EXPAND("the project name is: $(project.name)")

-- __IMPORT and __ENCODE data transforms emitting as Lua literals.
--
-- __IMPORT(pipelineSpec, importRef)
-- __ENCODE(pipelineSpec, literalValue)
--
-- pipelineSpec is a single comma-chain of codecs/transforms.
-- It contains exactly one value codec, and everything before that is
-- interpreted as the source codec + byte transforms.
-- Whitespace is ignored.
--
-- Outputs either values or string (not a table literal)
--    local t = { __ENCODE(...) }
-- => local t = { 1,2,3 }
--
--    local a,b,c = __ENCODE(...)
-- => local a,b,c = 1,2,3

-- Source codecs (string input):
--   u8, s8, u16le, s16le, u24le, s24le, u32le, s32le

--   f16le, f16be, f32le, f32be, f64le, f64be
--   hex, b85+1, ascii, utf8, base64
-- Source codecs (binary input only):
--   raw, lz
-- Byte transforms:
--   lz, unlz, rle, unrle, ttz, take(start,length)
--
-- start is 0-based.
--
-- Value codecs:
--   u8, s8, u16le, s16le, u24le, s24le, u32le, s32le
--   u16be, s16be, u24be, s24be, u32be, s32be
--   f16le, f16be, f32le, f32be, f64le, f64be
--   hex, b85+1, ascii, utf8, base64
-- Value transforms:
--   norm, scale(k), q(B), w(W), toUppercase
--
-- where `k` is scalar (required)
-- where `B` is fractional bits
-- where `W` is maximum # of decimals after point

-- hex literal to normalized RGBA bytes
local c = { __ENCODE("hex,u8,norm", "#ff8000"), 0.5 }

-- base85+1 encoding with LZ compression in the source spec
local paletteCompressed = __IMPORT("ascii,lz,b85+1", "import:creditstxt")

-- while it seems like "import:" is redundant, it's necessary because
-- it stays consistent with #include syntax and allows shared parsing/handling of import reference spec strings.

-- Literals are not supported and should error. Reasoning:
-- 1. we don't know the source encoding
-- 2. we don't want to create another weird syntax like "hex:123456"
-- 3. we don't want to make overloads of this function just for literals.

-- ...So we have another function: __ENCODE where you must specify the input encoding,
-- output spec, and the literal source value.
-- only string-based source format types are supported (so no "raw" for example, but "b85+1,lz" is ok)
local paletteString = __ENCODE("hex,lz", "b85+1", "1f17143439434e5a6d5d8da289baabb8cfb9839c77727546383f38704b63a66470b8948ec8bfbfe1e6eaa48db6785a96")

-- once again, "import:" is required for consistency, and to allow literals (though it's not much

local s = __ENCODE("ascii", "ascii", "the project name is: $(project.name)") -- effectively the same as __EXPAND

-- macros are handy esp for writing optimized code (avoid symbol lookups, plus give
-- the minifier the chance to simplify / reduce expressions.
-- note that the macro call site should still be valid lua. similar reasoning
-- as preprocessor directives, and for example if the call site is `@clamp`,
-- things like autocomplete & formatting just won't work.
-- so like C, just blend in as a normal symbol and it's up to developers to avoid
-- conflicts.
-- by convention i'm guessing best to go all upper-case, and/or double-underscore prefix.
--#macro CLAMP(x, lo, hi) -- or __CLAMP
  ((x) < (lo) and (lo) or (x) > (hi) and (hi) or (x))
--#endmacro

-- example usage
local y = CLAMP(x + blah(y),
  0,
  1)

-- single-line macro syntax uses the arrow operator.
--#macro ADD(a, b) => ((a) + (b))

-- parameterless syntax is possible
--#macro PROJECT_NAME => __EXPAND("the project name is: $(project.name)")

```

# Code chunk behavior

Code chunk banks on cart are semantically slightly different than other chunk
types. Most of the time it's the simple, independent banks.

But when code is loaded by TIC-80, all code banks are concatenated in sequence.

Therefore, it's a warning to specify the bank explicitly for code chunks. But still
allowed as long as there's no conflict.

But if code wants to span multiple banks (larger than 1 bank), then no specified code banks should be
allowed (this is an error).

And for the code chunk alone, if code is larger than 1 bank, it gets automatically
split across multiple banks.

# FAQ

i one day hope to be asked questions.
